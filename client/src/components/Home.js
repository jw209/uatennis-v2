                As leaders, club officers strive to make every member feel like they belong at UAs tennis club. As officers, we make sure that we are allowing the most opportunities for our members so that they can grow not only as tennis players, but as young adults.
                <br/><br/>
                Our goals for the future include growing membership, arranging year-round play, and attending intercollegiate tournaments. We hope that you enjoy every match with us. If there are any questions or issues, please contact us.
